    <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Our Vision</h2>
    <p className="text-lg mb-4 text-justify">
      Our vision is to revolutionize education by creating a world where every student, regardless of their neurodiversity or geographical location, has access to personalized, inclusive, and high-quality learning opportunities. We believe that education should adapt to the student, not the other way around.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg mb-4 text-justify">
      The current educational landscape often imposes rigid structures that fail to address the diverse needs of learners. We envision breaking these barriers by introducing an ML-enabled e-learning framework that provides dynamic and adaptive learning paths tailored to each studentâ€™s unique strengths and challenges.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg mb-4 text-justify">
      Our project aims to empower neurodiverse students by offering them a safe, supportive, and engaging environment where they can thrive. Through advanced technologies like Genetic Algorithms and multimodal content delivery, we seek to create a learning system that not only teaches but inspires and motivates.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg mb-4 text-justify">
      Ultimately, we aspire to bridge the gap between technology and education, making personalized learning a reality for students across the globe. Our vision is to cultivate a generation of empowered learners who are equipped to excel in their academic and personal pursuits.
