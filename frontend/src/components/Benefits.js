    <p className="text-lg text-justify mb-4">
      Our e-learning framework directly addresses the challenges faced by neurodiverse students, offering a wide array of benefits that redefine the educational experience for these learners. Traditional systems often overlook the unique needs of individuals with ADHD, dyslexia, or other neurodiverse traits, leading to disengagement and frustration. Our framework seeks to change that narrative.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg text-justify mb-4">
      <strong>1. Personalized Learning Paths:</strong> By leveraging advanced Genetic Algorithms (GA), students are provided with optimal and customized learning paths that align with their individual profiles. This ensures that the learning process is not only effective but also enjoyable and engaging.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg text-justify mb-4">
      <strong>2. Multimodal Content Delivery:</strong> Students receive instructional materials in formats best suited to their learning styles, whether it be visual, auditory, or interactive content. This variety ensures higher engagement and better retention of concepts.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg text-justify mb-4">
      <strong>3. Accessibility for Remote Areas:</strong> The framework eliminates geographical barriers, providing high-quality education to students in remote areas without the need for physical presence or extensive resources like personal tutors.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg text-justify mb-4">
      <strong>4. Real-Time Feedback and Adaptive Learning:</strong> Through ML, the system monitors student progress and provides real-time feedback, adapting learning paths based on their performance and engagement levels. This ensures continuous improvement and a more interactive experience.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg text-justify mb-4">
      By focusing on inclusivity, adaptability, and accessibility, our project transforms the way education is delivered to neurodiverse students, empowering them to overcome traditional learning challenges and unlock their full potential.
