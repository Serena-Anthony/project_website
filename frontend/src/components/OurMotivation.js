    <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Our Motivation</h2>
    <p className="text-lg mb-4 text-justify">
      Our motivation stems from the growing need to create an inclusive educational environment where every student, regardless of their cognitive or learning abilities, can thrive. Traditional education systems often overlook the diverse needs of neurodiverse students, leaving them to navigate an inflexible and overwhelming framework that may not cater to their unique strengths and challenges.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg mb-4 text-justify">
      For instance, students with conditions like ADHD, dyslexia, or autism spectrum disorder often face difficulties in focus, comprehension, and sensory processing. These challenges are exacerbated in environments that fail to offer tailored support, leading to feelings of frustration and disengagement. Our project seeks to address these gaps by providing a solution that not only meets the needs of neurodiverse students but also sets a new standard for adaptive learning.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg mb-4 text-justify">
      Beyond addressing individual challenges, this project is motivated by the potential to provide equal opportunities for students in remote and underserved areas. E-learning frameworks eliminate geographical barriers, ensuring that high-quality, customized education is accessible to all. This inclusivity is not just an option but a necessity in today's interconnected world.
